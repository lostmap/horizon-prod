    The material design theme is now broken with pyScss 1.3.7
    (also see the upgrade notice section).
    If you really depends on the material design theme, keep using
    pyScss 1.3.4 with setuptools<45 (while the horizon dependencies list
    says pyScss>=1.3.7 is required).
    The issue is tracked via [:bug:`1771559`].
upgrade:
  - |
    pyScss 1.3.7 is now required due to the incompatibility that
    pyScss 1.3.4 used before in horizon does not work with setuptools 46.
