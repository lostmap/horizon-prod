My problem (and so solution) was yet different from those described above.
I wasn't using models.py file, but created a models directory and created the my_model.py file there, where I put my model. Django couldn't find my model so it wrote that there are no migrations to apply.
My solution was: in the my_app/models/__init__.py file I added this line: from .my_model import MyModel
